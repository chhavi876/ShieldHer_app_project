# **App Name**: Guardian Angel

## Core Features:

- Threat Detection: Uses the phone's sensors (microphone, accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS) to detect potential threats based on acoustic signatures, motion patterns, and location context. Guardian AI uses this tool to prevent dangerous scenarios.
- Contextual Analysis: Analyzes contextual inputs such as trusted devices and user-defined safe zones to reduce false alarms and improve threat detection accuracy.
- Automated Shield Mode: Automatically activates 'Shield Mode' when the Threat Confidence Score exceeds a pre-set threshold, initiating evidence capture, alert cascade, and on-screen deterrents.
- Evidence Capture: Records a 30-second video (including pre-trigger context) and uploads it to a secure cloud vault for potential legal proceedings.
- Alert Cascade: Sends pre-configured alert messages with a live Google Maps link to the user's emergency contacts via SMS and push notification.
- On-Screen Deterrent: Displays a bright, flashing alert on the phone screen and can activate a loud siren to attract attention and deter potential attackers.
- User Control: Allows users to configure Safe Zones, Trusted Devices, and a Standby Mode to customize the system's sensitivity and prevent false alarms.
